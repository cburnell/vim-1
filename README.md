Vim
===
This is my personal .vimrc as well as an install script to get 
you up and going on a new system. I am using pathogen to 
manage all the plugins. The install script with fetch each plugin
and install it into ~.vim/bundles which pathogen with then add 
to your vim runtime files.

Installed Plugins
=================
* supertab 
* tcomment

FONTS
=============
The Linux fonts rely on the Inconsolata font which can be downloaded from the link below

If you are running Fedora you can install the Inconsolata fonts with yum.
