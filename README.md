Vim
===

This is not intended to be a general purpose plugin manager for Vim,
only to install a small set up plugins that I use.

After a clean os install run install.sh to get Vim up and going. 

The idea behind this setup script is to download the plugins 
directly from github and then create symbolic links to ~/.vim
so we are always running the latest and greatest code

Installed Plugins
=================
* supertab - allows omnicomplete to run by just hitting the tab button
    * https://github.com/ervandew/supertab
* tcomment - allows block commenting of code 
    * https://github.com/tomtom/tcomment_vim

    * https://github.com/shanep/taglist.vim
* gocode - omnicomplete for go
